# Dotfiles: The Dan Eden Story

I have no idea what I’m doing, but with any luck, that’ll change the more I use
my own dotfiles.

## Installation

1. In your home folder (just type `cd` in terminal to get there, silly), run
   `git clone https://github.com/daneden/dotfiles .dotfiles`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run `./setup.sh`
3. Party.

## What's Inside?

1. A script that copies dotfiles to my home directory to configure things like
   git, vim, and zsh
2. zsh configuration that provides a useful prompt and some aliases
3. git configuration that provides my own details and some aliases
4. vim configuration that provides some plugins and sets some preferences
5. A Brewfile to install common apps and CLI tools I use frequently
6. Yarn/Node global package installation
