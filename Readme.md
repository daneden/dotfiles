# Dotfiles: The Dan Eden Story

I have no idea what I’m doing, but with any luck, that’ll change the more I use my own dotfiles.

## Installation

1. In your home folder (just type `cd` in terminal to get there, silly), run
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/daneden/dotfiles .dotfiles`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run `./setup.sh`
3. Party.

## What's Inside?

These dotfiles give you a bunch of things. Here's a few of them:

- [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) as your bash replacement/zsh
  framework
- Pip and [Codemod](https://github.com/facebook/codemod)
- A bunch of Homebrew
  [packages](https://github.com/daneden/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile)
- A bunch of Vim plugins and Vim configuration
- Neovim as a Vim replacement
- A zsh configuration with useful aliases

That's about it. Everything in here is (obviously) catered to my own needs, so
you may be better off forking this repo or starting your own dotfiles repo.
Unless you're me. Hi, Dan! New computer? Nice!
