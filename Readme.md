# Dotfiles: The Dan Eden Story

I have no idea what I’m doing, but with any luck, that’ll change the more I use my own dotfiles.

## Installation

1. In your home folder (just type `cd` in terminal to get there, silly), run
   `git clone https://github.com/daneden/dotfiles .dotfiles`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run `./setup.sh`
3. Party.

## What's Inside?

These dotfiles used to be pretty complex, but now they're just a layer of customisations on top
of [skwp/dotfiles](http://skwp.github.io/dotfiles/), for a couple of reasons:

1. Maintaining my own dotfiles completely turned out to be a lot of work. This way, the onus is
   no longer on me to keep things running smoothly.
2. My employer's remote servers only whitelist a few GitHub repositories. This was one of them.
   My own dotfiles repo was not.
